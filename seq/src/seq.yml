          This must not be NaN. If omitted, defaults to 1.
    - INCREMENT:
        help: >
          The step/increment added after each preceeding number in the
          sequence.

          If FIRST is greater than LAST, this should be a positive
          number; if less than, this should be a negative number. This
          must not be 0 or NaN. If omitted, defaults to 1 even if FIRST
          is greater than LAST.
    - LAST:
        help: >
          The limit of the sequence.
        long_help: >

          If the next number in a sequence exceeds above or falls below
          LAST whether STEP is positive or negative respectively, the
          sequence ends. This must not be NaN.
