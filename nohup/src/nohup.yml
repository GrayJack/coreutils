about: "Run a commmand and ignore SIGHUP signals. If standard input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable file.
If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if possible,
'$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.
If standard error is a terminal, redirect it to standard output.
To save output to FILE, use 'nohup COMMAND > FILE'.

NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually supersedes
the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's documentation
for details about the options it supports."
