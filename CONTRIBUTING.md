## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
* First line should always start with the name of the tool that the code is being modified, followed by `:`.
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.

**Git Commit Messages Template**
```
<TOOL/LIB>: <SUBMODULE>: <SUBSUBMODULE>: <MESSAGE>
```

**Git Commit Messages Example**
```
Core: Groups: Blablabla bla bla
```
```
Id: Implement flag '-a'
```

### Tools Styleguide
* Always use `clap` with `yaml` support to create the tools arguments.
* Always create a `build.rs` that creates every shell completions.
* Every argument have to have the `help` text.
* Every parameter have to have the `long` and `short` options.
* Every tool messages should follow this format: `<tool>: <message>` or `<tool>: <message>: <submessage>`
* Every tool should have exit code the same as the original tools

### Rust Styleguide
* Don't use nightly only features.
* The code must be formatted with this repository `rustfmt` configuration `rustfmt.toml`, otherwise the CI will fail.
  * Install the toolchain with: `rustup toolchain install nightly` and then format your code with `cargo +nightly fmt`. Be sure that `cargo +nightly fmt -- --check` doesn't print anything.
* Documentation should always be included when needed, for both functions, methods, modules, etc.
* Tests, when possible, should always be included/updated with your changes.
* Always comment what you're doing if it's not obvious, should be before the code that need explaining.
