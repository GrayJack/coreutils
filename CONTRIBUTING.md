# Contributing to coreutils

üéâüëç First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üëçüéâ

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to `coreutils`. These are
mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment and feel free to propose
changes to this document in a pull request.

If you want to implement a tool from scratch, surely read the
[**Creating a Tool**](#creating-a-tool) section for orientation on where to
start from.

## Code of Conduct

The Code of Conduct for this repository [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Reporting Bugs Or Suggesting Enhancements

In the [Issues tab](https://github.com/GrayJack/coreutils/issues), click
`New issue`, select `Bug report` or `Feature request`, then add the required
information and submit it.

## Pull Requests

Always direct the Pull Request to the `dev` branch, try to be as descriptive as
possible.

## Creating a Tool

To start a tool, copy the template:

```sh
cp .template -r <TOOL_NAME>
```

Now you can start editing files inside of the new directory (_TOOL_NAME_)

Here is a list of steps you should follow (not necessarily in order):

- Add the TOOL_NAME to all TOML files related to a platform so CI can better
  test your code
- Replace _"template"_ occurrences in [`build.rs`](.template/build.rs) by the
  TOOL_NAME.
- Make changes in [`Cargo.toml`](.template/Cargo.toml) indicated fields.
- Configure argument parsing with `clap` at [`cli.rs`](.template/src/cli.rs),
  here are some rules:
  - Every `Arg` needs a `.help()`.
  - About the flags:
    - Every flag needs, `.long()` and `.short()` options
    - If the option is specified by the
      [POSIX standard](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html),
      use the short flag option specified.
    - For long options and short options that are not specified by the
      [POSIX standard](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html),
      the flag should match other famous coreutils implementations names (if
      needed, use _clap_'s `.visible_alias()` or `.visible_aliases()` to fill
      this requirement) renaming long options can be discussed in the PR.
- Every help message should start with upper case letter and end with a dot.
- Exit code is defined by the
  [POSIX standard](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/idx/utilities.html)
  (extra customization might be required for extensions).
- We recommend that you create a Pull Request with check boxes (see an
  [example](https://github.com/GrayJack/coreutils/pull/121)).
- Update the README with the new status of the tool and contributors section.
- Create your PR.

You can create an in-progress PR, as well as a completed one.

Use the PR to debate, ask questions and ask for reviews (don't forget to be
respectful and follow the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONFUCT.md)).

## Rust Style Guide

- Don't use nightly-only features.
- The code must be formatted by `rustfmt` using `rustfmt.toml` configuration,
  otherwise the CI will fail.
  - Install the _toolchain_ with: `rustup toolchain install nightly`, format
    your code with `cargo +nightly fmt` and be sure that
    `cargo +nightly fmt -- --check` doesn't print anything.
- Main function should be the first block after global use statements and module
  statements (not module blocks).
- Documentation should always be included when needed, for functions, methods,
  modules, etc.
- Tests, when possible, should always be included/updated with your changes.
- Always comment what you're doing if it's not obvious, should be before the
  code that need explaining.
- Try to be conservative about dependencies, only add if it is very necessary or
  if it will add good amount of ergonomics with few sub-dependencies. (you can
  check the dependency tree using `cargo-tree` crate)
  - As for dependencies versions, use `"~<Version>"` for crates below 1.0 and
    `"^<Version>"` for crates above 1.0.
- Avoid unsafe Rust in the tools code, if necessary, add a function in
  `coreutils_core` crate with necessary abstractions.

## Git Commit Messages

- First line should start with the name of the tool that is being modified,
  followed by `:`.
- The second line is empty.
- Reference issues and pull requests goes on the description after the second
  line.

**Git Commit Messages Template:**

Format if you're editing submodule:

```
<TOOL/LIB>: <SUBMODULE>: <SUBSUBMODULE>: <DESCRIPTION>
```

If there's no submodule:

```
<TOOL/LIB>: <DESCRIPTION>
```

**Examples:**:

```
Mkdir: Added --mode option
```

```
Mkdir: add nested use imports and log error messages to stderr
```

```
Core: mkfifo: simplify the logic of mkfifo function
```
