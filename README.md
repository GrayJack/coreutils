<!-- [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FGrayJack%2Fcoreutils.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FGrayJack%2Fcoreutils?ref=badge_large) -->

An in-progress safe implementation of `coreutils` aiming for a minimal and yet
complete set of utilities. This project aims at the _POSIX_ specification basic
requirements, plus common and useful features present in other implementations
of the utility.

This project has no intent to be 100% compatible with _GNU's coreutils_, like
[Uutils' coreutils](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils), but if it happens to
be, it's okay too.

## Minimum Rust Version Policy

This project's minimum supported `rustc` version (_MSRV_) is _1.58.0_.

This will not be conservative until we get to a _1.0_ version. So it can be
changed at any point in time.

<!-- In general, this project will try to be conservative concerning the minimum supported version of Rust, but in case of safety reasons it may bump at any time [e.g. `MaybeUninit` stabilization on 1.36.0 fixing huge problems with `std::mem::uninitialized()`] or improvements that affect positively conditional compilation (we use it a lot). -->

## Compilation tests guarantees

The compilation is tested for Rust Tier 1 and Tier 2 _x86_64 Unix/Unix-like_
platforms (except _Redox_), with _CI_.

All platforms are tested on _MSRV_ and _stable_ _Rust_, and Tier 1 platforms are
also tested on _beta_ and _nightly_ _Rust_ (Tier 2 and 3 only guarantee _stable_
full capacity).

Also, note that Tier 3 Rust tests can fail before it hits the compilation check,
since my only option is to use a _Linux_ system, add the target, and do
`cargo check --target`, and they often are not available as a target for any
Tier 1 platforms. If you use one of these platforms and have the right MSRV
requirements and it build successfully, let me know, if it fails, open an issue
with the compilation error.

## Compilation

Since not all targets provide full _Unix_ API coverage (they aren't _Unix_ or
lack _libc_ crate support), some can provide a `Cargo.toml` that have all
utilities that should work on the target.

### Compilation example for

```sh
cp <PLATFORM>.toml Cargo.toml
cargo build --release
```

<!-- ### Install example
```sh
cp <Platform>.toml Cargo.toml
cargo install --path .
``` -->
